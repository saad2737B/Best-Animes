        <h2>Where To Start?</h2>
        <p><ul><li><b>Watch the Anime – Start with Episode 1:</b></li>
The anime adaptation brings the story to life with vibrant animation, heartwarming moments, and unforgettable characters. It’s the perfect introduction to Loid, Yor, and Anya’s not-so-ordinary family life. You can find it on streaming platforms like Crunchyroll and Netflix (availability may vary by region).</p>

 <p><li><b>Read the Manga – Begin at Chapter 1</b></li>
Want to experience the story in its original form? The Spy x Family manga by Tatsuya Endo is where it all began. It’s full of clever storytelling and emotional depth, with extra moments you won’t always see in the anime. Ideal for readers who want to go beyond the screen.</p></ul><br>
    <h2>Main Charecters:</h2>
    <p><ol><li><b>Loid Forger (Codename: Twilight)</li></b>
A master of disguise, quick thinking, and calm under pressure — Twilight is the Westalis government's top spy. To prevent a war, he must create the perfect fake family for an undercover mission. Under the alias Loid Forger, he becomes a charming psychiatrist and devoted “father.” But balancing spy life with pretend parenting? That’s a mission of its own.</p>

 <p><li><b>Yor Forger (Codename: Thorn Princess)</li></b>
By day, Yor is a sweet and soft-spoken city hall employee. By night, she’s an elite assassin known as the Thorn Princess, feared for her deadly skills. To keep her double life hidden, she agrees to a marriage of convenience with Loid. Little does she know — everyone in this “family” has secrets of their own.</p>

 <p><li><b>Anya Forger</li></b>
An adorable orphan with a hidden ability — Anya can read minds. She’s the only one in the Forger family who knows everyone’s true identity, but she’s keeping quiet (mostly for fun and peanuts). Her chaotic energy, hilarious expressions, and desire to be part of a spy family make her the heart of the show.</p>

 <p><li><b>Bond</li></b>
The Forgers' loyal, oversized white dog. Bond may look fluffy, but he’s no ordinary pet — he has the ability to see into the future! Often seen protecting Anya or accidentally causing trouble, Bond is both a gentle giant and a secret weapon.</p>
