        <h1>One Piece</h1>
        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>Set sail on the greatest adventure in anime history. Welcome to the world of One Piece!

Created by Eiichiro Oda, One Piece is an epic tale of dreams, friendship, and freedom. The story follows Monkey D. Luffy, a boy who gains rubber-like powers after eating a Devil Fruit. His goal? To become the King of the Pirates by finding the legendary treasure known as the One Piece, left behind by the former Pirate King, Gol D. Roger.

But the Grand Line is no ordinary sea. It's filled with powerful pirates, dangerous seas, mysterious islands, ancient secrets, and the corrupt forces of the World Government. Along the way, Luffy builds his own pirate crew — the Straw Hat Pirates — each with their own dreams, pasts, and reasons for sailing.

One Piece is more than a pirate story. It's a journey about chasing your dreams no matter how impossible they seem. It’s about loyalty, laughter, loss, and never giving up — even when the whole world stands in your way.

With over 1000 episodes, a globally celebrated manga, record-breaking sales, and a passionate fanbase, One Piece has become one of the most iconic and beloved series of all time.

So grab your straw hat, hoist the anchor, and join us on the voyage of a lifetime.

This... is the era of dreams. This is the era of pirates. This is One Piece.</p>
<h2>Where To Start?</h2>
<p>With over 1000 episodes and manga chapters, One Piece can feel overwhelming at first. But once you set sail, you’ll never look back. Here's how to begin:</p>

<p><ol><li><b> Option 1: Start with the Anime (Episode 1 – East Blue Saga)</b></li>
If you love colorful visuals, voice acting, and epic soundtracks, the anime is a great place to begin. Start at Episode 1, where Luffy begins his journey and slowly builds his crew.
 Watch up to Episode 61 to complete the East Blue Saga (Luffy’s early adventures).</p>

 <p><li><b>Option 2: Start with the Manga (Chapter 1)</b></li>
The manga, written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda, is the original and most detailed version of the story. If you want faster pacing, no filler, and pure storytelling, the manga is the way to go.
Start at Chapter 1 and sail through the East Blue Saga at your own pace.</p></ol>
<h2>Main Charecters:</h2>
<p><ul><li><b>Monkey D. Luffy – Captain</b></li>
A carefree dreamer with a heart of gold and a hunger for meat (and adventure)! After eating the Gum-Gum Fruit, Luffy became a rubber man — able to stretch his body in wild ways. His goal is simple: to find the legendary One Piece and become King of the Pirates.</p>

 <p><li><b>Roronoa Zoro – Swordsman</b></li>
A master of the three-sword style and Luffy’s first crewmate. Zoro dreams of becoming the greatest swordsman in the world. He’s serious, loyal, and has a terrible sense of direction — but when it’s time to fight, no one stands taller.</p>

 <p><li><b>Nami – Navigator</b></li>
A brilliant cartographer and weather expert. Nami’s sharp mind and even sharper sense for treasure keep the crew alive (and funded). Once a thief, now the Straw Hats' guiding light through the Grand Line.</p>

 <p><li><b>Sanji – Cook</b></li>
The crew’s chef and a fierce martial artist who fights using only his legs. Sanji dreams of finding the All Blue, a legendary sea where all the world’s fish gather. He’s a hopeless romantic (especially around Nami and Robin), but deadly in a fight.</p>

 <p><li><b>Tony Tony Chopper – Doctor</b></li>
A blue-nosed reindeer who ate the Human-Human Fruit, giving him the ability to talk, think, and even transform. Chopper is the crew’s adorable (and often panicked) doctor, with a big brain and an even bigger heart.</p>

 <p><li><b>Nico Robin – Archaeologist</b></li>
Calm, intelligent, and mysterious. Robin can sprout limbs anywhere thanks to her Hana Hana Fruit powers. She seeks the true history of the world and is the only one who can read the ancient Poneglyphs.</p>

 <p><li><b>Franky – Shipwright</b></li>
A loud, eccentric cyborg who built the Straw Hats’ ship, the Thousand Sunny. With a love for cola and explosive gadgets, Franky is bold, brave, and totally SUPER!</p>

 <p><li><b>Brook – Musician</b></li>
A living skeleton who came back to life after eating the Revive-Revive Fruit. Brook is a swordsman, a gentleman, and a hilarious musician with a love for soul (and skull jokes).</p>

 <p><li><b>Jinbe – Helmsman</b></li>
A proud fish-man and former Warlord of the Sea. Jinbe is wise, powerful, and deeply loyal. His mastery of Fish-Man Karate and sense of honor make him a vital part of the crew.</p><ul>
